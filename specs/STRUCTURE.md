# Specification Structure

This document outlines the proper organization of specifications and identifies current inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

## Correct Directory Structure

```
specs/
├── MASTER_SPEC.md           # Root specification document
├── DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md      # Development process and iterations
├── STRUCTURE.md            # This document
│
├── generator/              # Generator Platform specifications
│   ├── README.md          # Generator overview
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md    # Core architecture
│   ├── PROCESS.md        # Process flow
│   ├── INTERFACE.md      # UI/UX specification
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md     # Deployment specification
│   └── MONITORING.md     # Monitoring specification

└── generated/             # Generated Applications specifications
    ├── README.md         # Generated apps overview
    ├── ARCHITECTURE.md   # Apps architecture
    ├── PROCESS.md       # Build and deployment process

```

## Identified Issues

1. **Redundant Directories**:
   - `core/` - Should be merged into `generator/`
   - `generation/` - Should be merged into `generator/`
   - `ui/` - Should be split between `generator/INTERFACE.md` and `generated/INTERFACE.md`
   - `deployment/` - Should be split between `generator/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `generated/DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - `monitoring/` - Should be split between `generator/MONITORING.md` and `generated/MONITORING.md`

2. **Missing Documentation**:
   - Generator platform overview (`generator/README.md`)
   - Generated applications overview (`generated/README.md`)
   - Clear separation between generator and generated app specifications

3. **Inconsistent References**:
   - Some documents reference non-existent files
   - Inconsistent path references in links
   - Missing cross-references between related documents

## Required Actions

1. **Directory Reorganization**:
   - Create proper directory structure as shown above
   - Move relevant content from redundant directories
   - Delete redundant directories

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Create missing README files
   - Update all cross-references
   - Ensure consistent path references

3. **Content Consolidation**:
   - Merge overlapping specifications
   - Remove duplicate information
   - Ensure clear separation of concerns

4. **Link Verification**:
   - Update all document links
   - Ensure all referenced files exist
   - Fix broken cross-references

## Specification Guidelines

1. **File Naming**:
   - Use UPPERCASE for specification files (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
   - Use standard case for directories (e.g., `generator/`)
   - Use descriptive, consistent names

2. **Document Structure**:
   - Clear hierarchy with proper headings
   - Consistent formatting
   - Complete table of contents
   - Version information

3. **Cross-References**:
   - Use relative paths for links
   - Include section anchors where appropriate
   - Maintain bidirectional references
