# UI/UX Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive user interface and user experience guidelines for generated applications. It ensures consistency, accessibility, and optimal user engagement across all generated web applications.

## Design System

### Visual Language

Our design system provides a cohesive visual language that ensures consistency and professionalism across all generated applications.

#### Typography System

The typography system is designed for optimal readability and hierarchy:

- **Primary Font**: Inter for modern, clean interface elements
- **Secondary Font**: System fonts as fallback
- **Scale**: A modular scale with a ratio of 1.25 for harmonious sizing
- **Weights**: Regular (400), Medium (500), and Bold (700) for clear hierarchy

#### Color System

The color system is designed for accessibility and visual harmony:

- **Primary Colors**: A carefully selected palette that ensures WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Secondary Colors**: Supporting colors for visual hierarchy and interaction states
- **Neutral Colors**: A range of grays for text, backgrounds, and borders
- **Semantic Colors**: Clear indicators for success, warning, error, and info states

### Layout System

The layout system ensures consistent spacing and alignment:

- **Grid System**: 12-column grid for flexible layouts
- **Spacing Scale**: 4px base unit with modular progression
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile-first responsive design with standard breakpoints
- **Container Widths**: Optimized for different screen sizes and content types

### Component Library

Our component library provides consistent, reusable building blocks:

#### Core Components

1. **Navigation Components**
   - Header with responsive navigation
   - Sidebar navigation for complex applications
   - Breadcrumb navigation for deep hierarchies

2. **Input Components**
   - Text inputs with validation states
   - Select menus with search capability
   - Date pickers with localization support
   - File upload with drag-and-drop

3. **Display Components**
   - Data tables with sorting and filtering
   - Cards for content organization
   - Modal dialogs for focused interactions
   - Toast notifications for system feedback

## Interaction Patterns

### User Input Handling

Clear guidelines for handling user interactions:

1. **Form Interactions**
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Clear error messaging
   - Autosave where appropriate
   - Smart defaults to reduce user effort

2. **Navigation Patterns**
   - Predictable routing
   - Progress indication
   - Back button support
   - History management

### Feedback Systems

Comprehensive feedback mechanisms:

1. **Loading States**
   - Skeleton screens for content loading
   - Progress indicators for operations
   - Optimistic UI updates where appropriate

2. **Error Handling**
   - Clear error messages
   - Recovery options
   - Fallback states
   - Offline support

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 Compliance

Ensuring applications are accessible to all users:

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - ARIA labels and roles
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Focus management

2. **Visual Accessibility**
   - Sufficient color contrast
   - Text scaling support
   - Alternative text for images
   - Reduced motion options

## Performance Guidelines

### Loading Optimization

Strategies for optimal loading performance:

1. **Initial Load**
   - Critical CSS inlining
   - Asset optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading

2. **Runtime Performance**
   - Efficient re-rendering
   - Memory management
   - Animation performance
   - Network optimization

## Implementation Requirements

### Development Standards

Clear requirements for implementation:

1. **Component Development**
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Styled-components for styling
   - Jest for testing
   - Storybook for documentation

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automated accessibility testing
   - Visual regression testing
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Cross-browser testing
