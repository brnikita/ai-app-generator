# Deployment Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive deployment strategy for generated applications. It ensures reliable, secure, and efficient deployment processes across different environments while maintaining high availability and performance.

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Types

Each application supports multiple deployment environments:

1. **Development Environment**
   - Purpose: Local development and testing
   - Features: Hot reloading, debug tools, detailed logging
   - Configuration: Development-specific settings

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Purpose: Pre-production testing and validation
   - Features: Production-like setup with monitoring
   - Configuration: Mimics production with test data

3. **Production Environment**
   - Purpose: Live application serving real users
   - Features: Full optimization, security measures
   - Configuration: Production-optimized settings

4. **Preview Environments**
   - Purpose: Feature branch testing and review
   - Features: Isolated testing environment per PR
   - Configuration: Staging-like with isolation
