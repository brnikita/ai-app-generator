4. Validate technical feasibility

Focus on making the system extensible and maintainable.
```

#### Step 2.3: Code Generation
**Prompt**:
```
Implement the AI-powered code generation system:
1. Create code generation templates
2. Implement context-aware code generation
3. Add code quality checks
4. Set up documentation generation

Ensure the generated code follows best practices and is well-documented.
```

### Iteration 3: User Interface
**Goal**: Create the user interface for the generator.

#### Step 3.1: Basic UI Setup
**Prompt**:
```
Help me create the basic Next.js UI setup:
1. Project creation wizard
2. Template selection interface
3. Configuration forms
4. Generation progress visualization

Focus on making the UI intuitive and user-friendly.
```

#### Step 3.2: Interactive Preview
**Prompt**:
```
Implement the interactive preview system:
1. Real-time blueprint visualization
2. Component preview
3. Configuration live preview
4. Validation feedback

Make the preview system responsive and performant.
```

#### Step 3.3: Dashboard
**Prompt**:
```
Create the main dashboard interface:
1. Project management
2. Generation history
3. Template management
4. Settings and preferences

Include proper state management and data fetching.
```

### Iteration 4: Generated Applications
**Goal**: Create the base templates for generated applications.

#### Step 4.1: Frontend Template
**Prompt**:
```
Help me create the base Next.js application template:
1. Project structure
2. Core components
3. State management setup
4. API integration
5. Styling system

Include best practices and proper TypeScript setup.
```

#### Step 4.2: Backend Template
**Prompt**:
```
Create the base Express.js backend template:
1. API structure
2. Database integration
3. Authentication system
4. Error handling
5. Logging setup

Focus on security and scalability.
```

#### Step 4.3: Infrastructure
**Prompt**:
```
Implement the infrastructure templates:
1. Docker configuration
2. Kubernetes manifests
3. CI/CD pipelines
4. Monitoring setup

Include proper documentation and deployment guides.
```

### Iteration 5: Testing & Documentation
**Goal**: Ensure quality and usability.

#### Step 5.1: Testing
**Prompt**:
```
Help me set up the testing infrastructure:
1. Unit tests for core components
2. Integration tests for generation process
3. E2E tests for UI
4. Template validation tests

2. API documentation
3. Template customization guides
4. Development guides

Make the documentation clear and well-structured.
```

## Development Guidelines

### For Each Iteration

1. **Start with**:
   ```
   Let's begin iteration X. First, we need to [specific task].
   Please help me implement [component] with the following requirements:
   1. [requirement 1]
   2. [requirement 2]
   ...
   ```

2. **During Development**:
   ```
   I need to modify [component] to add [feature/fix].
   Here's the current implementation: [code]
   Please help me update it to include: [requirements]
   ```

3. **Testing**:
   ```
   Help me create tests for [component] that cover:
   1. [test case 1]
   2. [test case 2]
   ...
   Include both positive and negative test cases.
   ```

4. **Review & Refactor**:
   ```
   Please review the current implementation of [component]:
   [code]
   Suggest improvements for:
   1. Code quality
   2. Performance
   3. Security
   4. Maintainability
   ```

### Quality Requirements

1. Each iteration must be completed before moving to the next
2. Each component must have:
   - TypeScript types/interfaces
   - Unit tests with minimum 80% coverage
   - Documentation
   - Error handling
3. Regular commits with meaningful messages
4. Code review after each major component
5. Documentation updates with each iteration
