# Web Application Generator: Master Technical Specification

## Document Purpose

This master specification serves as the root document for the complete technical specification of the web application generator system. The specification is divided into two main parts:
1. Generator Platform - The application that creates web applications
2. Generated Applications - The web applications produced by the generator
