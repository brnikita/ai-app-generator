# Project Realization Instructions

This document provides a full, step-by-step guide to realize the web application generator project from planning to deployment.

## 1. Project Planning
- Define project goals: Generate complete web applications via an interactive process for non-coders.
- Identify key requirements:
  - User-friendly interface
  - Detailed blueprint generation using the o3-mini model
  - Standardized tech stack for consistency
  - Containerization with Docker and Docker Compose for local testing and deployment
- Review the initial project plan and folder structure as described in the README.

## 2. Environment Setup
- Install Docker and Docker Compose on your local machine.
- Install additional dependencies (e.g., Node.js, npm) as required by the tech stack.
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project root.
- Verify the generated folder structure which includes:
  - docker, config, src (with backend and frontend), docs, tests, and scripts.

## 3. Folder Structure Overview
- **/README.md:** Overview, project plan, and blueprint.
- **/docker:** Contains Dockerfiles (backend.Dockerfile, frontend.Dockerfile) and instructions for building images.
- **/config:** Configuration files (e.g., .env, config.json) for environment-specific settings.
- **/src/backend:** Server-side code including controllers, models, routes, and services.
- **/src/frontend:** Client-side code including components, pages, assets, and styles.
- **/docs:** Documentation files (setup, deployment, user guide).
- **/tests:** Automated tests for backend and frontend.
- **/scripts:** Utility and automation scripts.

## 4. Application Development

### 4.1 Backend Development
- Develop APIs and server-side logic in **/src/backend**:
  - Create controllers in **/src/backend/controllers** to handle HTTP requests.
  - Define models in **/src/backend/models** for database interactions.
  - Map routes in **/src/backend/routes** to the corresponding controllers.
  - Implement business logic in **/src/backend/services**.
- Write inline documentation and code comments for maintainability.
- Create automated tests for the backend in **/tests/backend**.

### 4.2 Frontend Development
- Develop the client-side application in **/src/frontend** using a modern JS framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue):
  - Build reusable UI components in **/src/frontend/components**.
  - Develop distinct pages in **/src/frontend/pages**.
  - Manage static assets in **/src/frontend/assets**.
  - Organize styles in **/src/frontend/styles** (CSS, SASS, etc.).
- Integrate the frontend with backend APIs.
- Write tests for the frontend in **/tests/frontend**.

## 5. Containerization and Docker Setup
- **Dockerfiles:**
  - Use **/docker/backend.Dockerfile** to define the backend container (install dependencies, set environment variables, expose ports).
  - Use **/docker/frontend.Dockerfile** to define the frontend container (build assets, expose required ports).
- **Docker Compose:**
  - Configure **docker-compose.yml** at the project root to orchestrate multi-container deployment.
  - Define services, environment variables, port mappings, and volumes.
  - Test locally by running: `docker-compose up --build`.

## 6. Testing and Continuous Integration
- Set up automated tests using appropriate tools (e.g., Jest, Mocha) and organize them under **/tests**.
- Integrate tests into a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI).
- Run tests regularly to ensure stability and catch regressions.

## 7. Documentation and User Guidance
- Maintain detailed documentation in **/docs**:
  - **setup.md:** Instructions for environment setup and dependency installation.
  - **docs/deployment/README.md:** Step-by-step deployment guides for cloud providers (AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean).
  - **user_guide.md:** User instructions on using, configuring, and troubleshooting the application.
- Update documentation with every major project update.

## 8. Deployment and Maintenance
- Deploy the application using Docker:
  - Build container images and run them with `docker-compose`.
  - Follow deployment guidelines in **/docs/deployment** for your chosen hosting provider.
- Plan for ongoing maintenance:
  - Monitor logs and update dependencies regularly.
  - Provide support documentation and troubleshooting guides.

## 9. Future Enhancements
- Refine the AI-driven blueprint generation algorithm based on user feedback.
- Expand configuration options for advanced users while maintaining a standardized core.
- Explore additional tech stack options without compromising reliability.
- Optimize build processes and CI/CD pipelines for faster deployment.

## 10. Finalize and Delivery
- After thorough testing and documentation, package the complete application along with all configuration files.
- Provide a downloadable package that includes the full source code and detailed deployment instructions.
- Ensure end-user support and maintenance plans are in place for continuous improvement.

Follow these steps carefully to fully realize and implement the project from initial setup through production deployment.
